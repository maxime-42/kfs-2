## Segment

In the context of computer architecture, a memory segment refers to a contiguous block of memory with a specific purpose or attributes. Memory segmentation is a memory management technique used in certain architectures, such as x86 and x86-64. Segmentation divides the memory into logical segments, each with its own base address and size.
- [Code Segment] - Also known as the text segment, this is where the executable code of a program is stored. It includes instructions that the processor will execute
- [Data Segment] - The data segment contains global and static variables used by the program. This segment is further divided into initialized and uninitialized data sections.
- [Stack Segment] - The stack segment is used for the program's runtime stack. It stores local variables, function parameters, and return addresses. The stack operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.
- [Heap Segment] - The heap segment is used for dynamic memory allocation. It is where the program can request memory during its execution, and the allocation is managed by functions like malloc and free.
To clarify:

Each of these segment registers is 16 bits wide means that the values these registers can hold are 16 bits in size.
The registers themselves may have a physical size that is larger than 16 bits, but they are designed to hold 16-bit values.
So, while the registers are physically located in the processor, they operate based on 16-bit values for memory segmentation purposes. The actual data they hold, the segment selectors, are used to reference specific segments in memory.

## A logical address, also known as a virtual address

- A logical address, also known as a virtual address :
is an address generated by a program or a process in the context of virtual memory. In modern computer systems, the memory addressing model is often divided into two spaces: logical (virtual) address space and physical address space.

- Logical (Virtual) Address Space:
The logical address space is the range of addresses that a program or process can use. Each process has its own separate logical address space, and it doesn't directly correspond to the physical layout of memory.
Logical addresses are generated by the CPU during program execution and are used by the program to reference memory locations.

- Virtual Memory:
is a memory management technique that provides an "illusion" to processes that each one has its own dedicated space in the entire addressable memory range.
Logical addresses in virtual memory are mapped to physical addresses, which represent the actual locations in physical RAM.
- Address Translation:
The operating system, along with the memory management unit (MMU) of the CPU, is responsible for translating logical addresses to physical addresses. This translation is done using data structures such as page tables.
The mapping allows the operating system to move data in and out of physical memory (RAM) as needed, providing the illusion of a larger memory space than is physically available
- Logical Address Calculation:
A logical address in the x86 architecture is typically expressed as a combination of a segment selector and an offset within that segment. The actual memory address is calculated using the formula: Physical Address = Base Address of Segment + Offset.



## Global Descriptor Table (GDT):

The GDT is a system-wide table that contains descriptors for various memory segments. Each descriptor defines a segment of memory and includes information such as base address, limit, access rights, and segment type.
The GDT is typically set up by the operating system during system initialization and is stored in memory. It provides a way for the operating system to control and manage memory access for different tasks or processes.
The GDT is divided into entries, and each entry is a descriptor that defines a specific segment of memory. These segments could include code segments, data segments, and stack segments.
The GDT is loaded into the processor's memory management unit (MMU), which uses it to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses and enforce memory protection.
#### Analogie 
Imagine a library with a central catalog that contains information about all the books available in the library. This catalog is like the GDT. It's a system-wide reference that provides details about different categories of books, such as fiction, non-fiction, and reference materials.
Each entry in the catalog (GDT) describes a specific section or category of books, including its location, access rules (who can access it), and any special conditions (such as borrowing restrictions). The catalog is managed centrally and used by everyone in the library to find and access books.
| name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| base address | The base address refers to the starting memory address of a memory segment. |
| limit | The limit is the size of the segment, specifying how many bytes from the base address are accessible |
| access | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| selector | A segment selector is a numeric value stored in a segment register. It is used in conjunction with an offset to form a logical address. The combination of a segment selector and an offset produces a unique address in memory. The offset is typically a 16-bit value that represents a location within the segment.  |
| Granularity | Segmentation Granularity In memory segmentation, the granularity refers to the size of individual memory segments. Each segment has a base address and a limit, and the granularity determines the size of each segment. For example, if the granularity is 4 KB, each segment is 4 KB in size, and the system can allocate memory in 4 KB chunks. |


## Real mode

Real mode is a processor operating mode in x86 architecture, and it is one of the initial modes that the CPU can operate in during the early stages of system boot-up. Real mode is a compatibility mode designed to provide backward compatibility with the Intel 8086 and 8088 processors, the predecessors of modern x86 CPUs.

Here are key characteristics of real mode:

Memory Addressing:

Real mode uses a 20-bit address bus, allowing it to address up to 1 MB of memory. Memory addresses are specified as segments and offsets, and the physical address is calculated as segment * 16 + offset.
Segmentation:

Memory is divided into segments, each 64 KB in size. Segment registers (CS, DS, ES, SS) hold the segment value, and the offset is added to it to generate the physical address.
No Memory Protection:

Real mode lacks memory protection mechanisms. Any program can access any part of the memory, which can lead to accidental overwrites and crashes.
Interrupts:

Interrupt handling in real mode involves using an Interrupt Vector Table (IVT), and interrupts are identified by a single-byte interrupt number.
Registers:

Real mode provides a set of general-purpose registers, such as AX, BX, CX, and DX, with 16-bit sizes. It lacks many of the advanced features found in later operating modes.
Real mode is commonly used during the boot process of a computer system. Boot loaders and early-stage operating system components are often executed in real mode before transitioning to protected mode or other advanced modes that provide more sophisticated memory protection and multitasking capabilities.

It's important to note that while real mode is still present in modern x86 processors for compatibility reasons, contemporary operating systems generally switch to protected mode or long mode (for 64-bit systems) to take advantage of advanced features and better memory protection mechanisms.
